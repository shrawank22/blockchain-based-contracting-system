<p align="center"> The Blockchain Based Online Contracting/Tendering System is a multi-party blockchain system for recording, issuing and updating contracts for "M"
projects amongst "N" parties, each party start with a fixed number of tokens at start and gain/lose tokens as they get more projects or fail to deliver the same on time (duration "t" years). Our project uses blockchain technology which emphasis on the user security and anonymity, solidity programming language, and Truffle to deploy the contracts into Ganache local network.

## üßê About <a name = "about" id="about"></a>

This a blockchain based Online contracting DApp which for tender creation and bidding. This DApp gives better tender management than the existing DApp because it inovoles validators to validate the tenders before parties can bid on the tenders. Thus, this increases the trust of the platform and smooth functioning of online contracting. Also after the tender is assigned to a project, the platform also offers the managemnet of project by tracking milestones until its completion. The parties, validators, bidders, stakeholders receive rewards as each milestones are completed.

```

### Installing

Follow the below steps to run the code in local environment:
1. Clone the project repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shrawank22/blockchain-based-contracting-system.git

    ``` 
2. In the root directory of the project to install nodu=e module from package.json for contacts and backend
    ```
    npm install

    ```
3. Go the frontend directory of the project in another terminal to install nodu=e module from package.json for frontend angular app
    ```
    npm install

    ```
4. To compile and deploy the contracts into ganache test network
 - remote ganche network
  - add the following to truffle-config.js to
    ```
    networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*" //Match any network id
     }
    },

    ```
  - add the following to server.js to listen to the remote ganche test netowrk
    ```
    const Web3 = require('web3');
    var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://127.0.0.1:8545'))

    ```
  - Command to start ganche network
    ```
    ganche-cli

    ```
  - command to compile and deploy the contracts
    ```
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate

    ```

 - local ganche network
  - add the following to truffle-config.js to
    ```
    networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*" //Match any network id
     }
    },

    ```
  - add the following to server.js to listen to the remote ganche test netowrk
    ```
    const Web3 = require('web3');
    var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://127.0.0.1:7545'))

    ```
  - To start local ganache network open the Ganache apllication in either quickstart or workspace

  - command to compile and deploy the contracts
    ```
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate

    ```
5. Start the NodeJs server using the following command:
    ```
    npm run satrt

    ```
    The server is started on http://127.0.0.1:8082 listening to ganache test network.

6. Now run the frontend angular app using the following command
    ```
    npm start

    ```
    The Angular app starts on http://localhost:4200

## üéà Usage <a name="usage" id="usage"></a>

1. The http://localhost:4200/ lands you on login page. To register on the platform click on register link.
2. Once the user/party register , it asks you to login.
3. After logging in you can see you profile name on the navbar. You can find various pages on the dashboard.
4. The dashboard contains the tenders that need to be validated by party if any, then select the winner bid out of top 5 bids, if any of party tender.
5. Then active tenders contains the list of all ongoing tenders you can bid to as long as party are not owner or validator of the project.
6. The tenders tab contains all the tenders created by the tender. party can edit or delete only the newly created tenders and view the bids placed on it once the tender is accepting bids.
7. The Bids tab contains all the bids the party placed on various tenders. Party can edit/delete with the tender deadline only and view the tender details of each bid.
8. Finally, the project tab contains the project created by or assigned to party and milestones tracking.
9. The party logout from the app by clicking on profile -> logout.
